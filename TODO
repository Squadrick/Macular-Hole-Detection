macula_data/negative has a lot of shitty images, filter out the good ones, at least 85

Make a cropping mechanism for easily cropping out the maculas (OpenCV)

Resize all excrated macula into a uniform (128*128)

Data augmentation(*) -- rotation, brightness, invert, warp

Do some basic preprocessing

Split into train, val, test

Feature extracts -- HOG

Build the classifiers using sklearn -- 
	SVM
	Naive Bayes
	Neural network
	KNN
	K-Means
	Decision Tree
